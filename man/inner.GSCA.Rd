\usage{
inner.GSCA(S, W, inner.mod, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{S}{Covariance matrix of the data.}

\item{W}{Weight matrix, where the indicators are on colums and composites are on the rows.}

\item{inner.mod}{A square matrix specifying the relationships of the composites in the model.}

\item{...}{Other parameters are ignored}
}
\value{
A matrix of unscaled inner weights \code{E} with the same dimesions as \code{inner.mod}.
}
\description{
This implements the first step of the GSCA estimation describe by Hwang & Takane (2004). GSCA inner estimation should
be used only with GSCA outer estimation.
}
\details{
The first step of GSCA estimation method, as describe by Hwang & Takane (2004), involves estimating all model regressions,
including also the relationships from composites toward indicators in the first step.

The implementation of GSCA in matrixpls differs from the Hwang & Takane (2004) version in that during the
first step, only regressions between composites are estimated. The reason for this is that the
relationhips from the composites to indicators are simple regressions that are simply the covariances between
the indicators and compositess. Since these covariances need to be calculated in the second step, it is more
efficient to not calculate them during the first step.

This algorithm is therefore identical to the PLS path weighting scheme with the exception that correlations
are not used for inverse relationships and there is no falling back to identity scheme for composites
that are not connected to other composites.
