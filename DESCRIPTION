Description: MatrixPLS is a matrix based implementation of Partial Least Squares Path Modeling
   algorithm. This package is computationally more efficient and more modular than the two
   other R packages implementing the Partial Least Squares algorithms and
   does not require raw data but calculates the PLS estimates from a covariance matrix.
   The package is designed towards Monte Carlo simulations and includes functions to
   perform simple Monte Carlo simulations.
